## Grails Switcher ##

Grails has frequent, active updates... faster, usually, then teams that are using the framework can safely upgrade to. If you work on several different Grails projects, it can be cumbersome switching your 'GRAILS_HOME' around to the appropriate version. Sure, many IDEs can handle the version for you if you run within the app, but if you're like me, you prefer running from the command line. I've been doing it by hand for a while now, but with the frequent 2.0 release candidates, I've worked up a little app to help me along.

Thus, the purpose of this application is to provide a quick method for switching your Grails versions.
